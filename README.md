## Hi, I'm Shubham 👋

I enjoy solving complex problems and making systems work better than before.
I naturally think in terms of architecture and flow — not just features or screens.

Over time, I’ve developed a habit of digging deep into technical challenges,
whether it’s refining frontend interactions, improving backend logic,
or fixing performance bottlenecks that others tend to skip.

I like getting things right, not just getting them done.
